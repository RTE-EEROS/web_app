# LIFOWI model

This repository is a pure python export of the lif-owi model.
It does not have dependency to *Brightway2*, *lca_algebraic* nor *ecoinvent*

It only relies on *sympy* and *numpy*.

# Installation 

Install the dependencies 

> pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage 

The model is encoded into [model.json](./model.json) .

The class *Model* can parse it and evaluate impacts.

The file [sample_usage.py](./sample_usage.py) shows typical usage.

## Loading the model

Parsing the model is long (around 20 seconds).  

Do it only once and keep it in memory.

```python
model = Model.from_file(FILENAME)
```

## Evaluate the model

```python
val, unit = model.evaluate(
    impact,
    functional_unit,
    axis,
    **params)   
```

### Arguments :

#### impact

The code of the chosen impact.

List of impacts :

### Example calls


#### Total axis
```python
model.evaluate(
    "climate_change",
    "power",
    "total",
    n_turbines=2) # Example of setting a parameter
```

Returns a single value and the unit :

```python
(17375068.714683194, 'kg CO2-Eq/MW')
```

#### System axis 

```python
model.evaluate(
    "climate_change",
    "energy",
    "system_1",

  'offshore substation': 0.00199266754489728,
  'export cables': 0.22898922381096948,
